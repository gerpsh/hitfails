# HITFails
Health IT sucks sometimes.  This site lets you talk about it.

## Purpose
Good user feedback for health IT can be difficult to collect and analyze.  Practitioners are busy, have varied needs as users, 
and sometimes have difficulty verbalizing what they want out of a health IT application.  This site facilitates honest feedback 
between health IT users and the people who design it.
